# AJut.UX
A shared portion of the C# / dotnet 8 utility library (used in both the WinUI and WPF projects), created by AJ Badarni

## Greetings
I hope you enjoy using ajut.ux. AJut is short for AJ Utilities, (pronounced like the dipping sauce Au Jus). This ux library contains controls, converters, extensions, content navigation, theming helpers, dark and light themes, utilities - and much more. I've been building these up since I first started developing - through the many side projects I've done over the years. The goal was to provide a simple project reference (ajut.core + ajut.ux.wpf) that will allow you to build and innovate without having to start completely from scratch or to have to bring in many many libraries to get things done.

Many of these are my takes on ideas that aren't new - and yet those ideas have to be rewritten everywhere we develop... and I find that a shame. Many ideas in here are of my own innovation! The unique difference is that everything is in support of how I like to develop, and I hope you will enjoy doing things this way too!

## Final Message
I hope you are able to find ajut.ux useful!

Thanks!
